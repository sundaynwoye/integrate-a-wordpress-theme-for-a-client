# integrate-a-wordpress-theme-for-a-client
Your new client is a real estate agency in the mountains. It still has no website to show off its luxury chalets for sale! Rough life. üè∞üèî

The agency hopes to update its website regularly alone without needing to pester you. You decide to build them a Wordpress site that they can edit what they need to and adjust a theme for their needs, though you'll do most of the work up front.

Step 1: Install WordPress and a theme
Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired you to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.

They want a "clear, uncluttered, design that exudes luxury." You'll have to offer them this result via a WordPress theme, which will require installation and configuration. You should customize the theme so that the agency feels like their brand is well-represented. Pay attention to detail! üîé

You should not only choose a theme but also make light modifications to the CSS of the theme that could help deliver the intended result. 

In the project, you'll add:

A dozen chalets total, with a mix of for sale and for rent (make them separate!)

A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form

A WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests
The website will actually be online so that the agency can see it!

Files to provide:

A text file explaining which WordPress theme was chosen and why

URL of the WordPress site hosted online

A CSS file of changes made to the theme

If you are not sure about the best way to host your website online, you can use webhost, as they offer free web hosting for wordpress.org. Make sure to selelct 'blog' and 'beginner' when setting up your account. However, we are not affiliated with webhost in any way and you are free to use the hosting service of your choice!

Step 2: Configure access and documentation
The agency is satisfied with your initial proposal but asks you how to add, edit, and delete chalets from their listings. You will need to create:

An administrator account for the agency director

An administrator account for the developer (you!), if it does not already exist

Editor accounts for two other agency employees

Once you've created these accounts, you'll provide WordPress instructions to the agency within a PDF of 3 to 5 pages. Bear in mind that they are not experts in creating websites; make sure you're very clear about how to add new chalets, edit existing ones, etc., so they have what they need in terms of instructions.
