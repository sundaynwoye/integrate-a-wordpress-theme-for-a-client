# Integrate a WordPress theme for a client - Openclassrooms
Step 1: Install WordPress and a theme
Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired you to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.

You should not only choose a theme but also make light modifications to the CSS of the theme that could help deliver the intended result. 

In the project, you'll add:

A dozen chalets total, with a mix of for sale and for rent (make them separate!)

A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form

A WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests
The website will actually be online so that the agency can see it!

Files to provide:

A text file explaining which WordPress theme was chosen and why

URL of the WordPress site hosted online

A CSS file of changes made to the theme

Step 2: Configure access and documentation
The agency is satisfied with your initial proposal but asks you how to add, edit, and delete chalets from their listings. You will need to create:

An administrator account for the agency director

An administrator account for the developer (you!), if it does not already exist

Editor accounts for two other agency employees

Once you've created these accounts, you'll provide WordPress instructions to the agency within a PDF of 3 to 5 pages. Bear in mind that they are not experts in creating websites; make sure you're very clear about how to add new chalets, edit existing ones, etc., so they have what they need in terms of instructions. 

Deliverables
Files to provide:

A screenshot of the admin accounts you've added to the WordPress site

Wordpress PDF documentation of use to the agency
